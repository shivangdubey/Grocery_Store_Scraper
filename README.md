# BigBasket_Scraper
Scraping data from BigBasket.com

The project's goal is to scrape product data from Bigbasket.com and save it in a reusable file that includes the product category, description, quantity, brand, and price, as well as the associated images. Web scraping techniques will be used to extract product data from Bigbasket.com and then store it in a structured format such as a CSV, JSON, or Excel file. The information can then be used for analysis, comparison, and other business purposes. The project can help e-commerce businesses keep track of their competitors' products and prices, as well as individuals interested in product analysis and research.
